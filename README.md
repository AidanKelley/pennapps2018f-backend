Non-compliance with the elderly is a large problem. There are a variety of reasons why someone may not take their medicine, and one of those is forgetfulness. My own Grandmother often forgot to take her medicine, and often had to have a nurse or family member remind her. However, many elderly people would prefer more independence, without needing to rely on a child or medical professional. Our project helps to solve this, by enabling Amazon's Alexa, connected to a backend which providers or family members can use, to tell patients when to take their medicine. Alexa tells patients when they need to take which medications and instructions for how to take them.
